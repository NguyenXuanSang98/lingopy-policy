      <strong>Terms of Service</strong><br>
      <p>These Terms of Service apply to the Lingopy app for mobile devices that was created by Nguyen Xuan Sang.</p>
      <br>
      <p>By downloading or using the Application, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully before using the Application. Unauthorized copying, modification, or distribution of the Application or any of its components is strictly prohibited. You may not extract the source code of the Application, translate it into other languages, or create derivative versions. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Service Provider is committed to ensuring that the Application is useful and efficient. Therefore, they reserve the right to modify the Application or charge for its services at any time and for any reason. The Service Provider will always clearly communicate any fees or charges related to the Application.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Application stores and processes personal data that you provide to the Service Provider to deliver its services. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advises against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, as such actions may compromise security, expose your device to malware or viruses, and cause the Application to malfunction.</p>
      <div>
         <p>Please note that the Application uses third-party services that have their own Terms of Service. You can review their Terms of Service through the link(s) below:</p>

            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play Services</a></li>
         </ul>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>The Service Provider is not responsible for certain circumstances that may affect your use of the Application. Some functions of the Application require an active internet connection, which can be Wi-Fi or mobile data. The Service Provider is not liable if the Application fails to function due to poor connectivity or data limitations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you use the Application outside a Wi-Fi area, please note that your mobile carrier’s terms and conditions still apply. This means you may incur data charges or other fees. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such costs, including roaming charges if you use the Application outside your home country or region without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device used, it is assumed that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Service Provider is not responsible for issues resulting from your actions, such as failing to keep your device charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Application, the Service Provider is not liable.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Although the Service Provider strives to keep the Application accurate and up to date, they rely on third parties for certain data. Therefore, the Service Provider accepts no liability for any direct or indirect losses resulting from reliance on the Application’s content or functionality.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Service Provider may update the Application at any time. The Application’s availability and compatibility with your device’s operating system may change. You must download updates to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee continuous compatibility or updates but expects users to accept new versions when offered. The Service Provider may also discontinue the Application at any time without prior notice. Upon termination, (a) all rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will end, and (b) you must stop using and, if necessary, delete the Application from your device.</p>
      <br><strong>Changes to These Terms of Service</strong>
      <p>The Service Provider may update these Terms of Service from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. The Service Provider will notify you of updates by posting the revised Terms of Service on this page.</p>

      <p>These Terms of Service are effective as of 2025-10-28.</p>
